# Customer_Segmentation


The goal is to provide an optimal way to group customers based on their similarities judging everyone based on their
common characteristics which will allow businesses to target each group appropriately and effectively. Given the
current market competition, it is critical to comprehend customer behavior, types, and interests. Understanding and
categorizing customers is a critical step in developing effective marketing strategies, particularly in targeted marketing.
Marketers can tailor their marketing strategies to one segment at a time by creating customer segments. For example, if
you own a clothing store, you might target customers during the holidays and offer them exclusive discounts.
The initial task is to study the dataset and provide the necessary descriptive analysis and frequency statistics for our data
which is described in the next subsection. The intermediate step is the division of a market into separate customer
groups with similar characteristics. Finally, we provide our insights in the form of shiny app dashboards for businesses.
My approach is critical for effective marketing because it allows you to target specific groups of customers with
different promotions, pricing options, and product placement that intrigue the target audience's interest in the most
cost-effective way. Our problem statement area has high potential and scope to tackle future requirements in
segmentation which can be a useful tool to identify unsatisfied customer needs in future.

## Target Users:
Sales manager, Sales head - To see the final cluster plots and clustered data
Engineering/Scrum managers – To see the EDA, verification of hyperparameters, results etc.
Below are the options in the side bar of the dashboard:

## Raw Data:
• To show peak of our dataset (sample number of rows of the data).
Exploratory data Analysis (EDA):
• Exploratory data analysis will help us get insights about the statistical measures and patterns in our dataset [2].
• We will show the statistical measures such a mean/median/mode, quartile ranges, datatype and handle missing
values/anomalies of each column.
• This section will also feature bar plots, scatter plots and box plots for the distinctive features of our dataset.
e.g., To show the counts of professions of the customers or counts of the gender in bar plot identify if there is any pattern.
Box plot of work experience column which shows the quartile ranges and outliers.

## Cluster determination:
• Here we will determine the ideal number of clusters suitable to cluster our dataset into.
• For example, for K-means we will show the elbow plot for determination of K in this section.
Cluster Analysis and plots:
• Here we will run cluster algorithm in R for our data and plot the result.
• E.g. For K means we would show the cluster plots with focus on any two features Work experience vs age, or gender
vs Profession.

## Final Clustered Data:
• Here we would show the final data with an additional column indicating the cluster.
